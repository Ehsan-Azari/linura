# Development infrastructure

Linura treats development infrastructure as part of the product safety boundary. The same repository-owned commands should be used locally, in CI, in VM acceptance, and in release proof whenever practical.

## Canonical entry point

```bash
cargo xtask check
```

This executes formatting, Clippy, workspace tests, repository invariants, and structured asset validation. Additional commands expose acceptance scenarios and build plans without requiring contributors to memorize implementation-specific scripts.

## Layers

```text
source + schemas
      ↓
 cargo xtask
      ↓
unit / contract / adversarial tests
      ↓
image and disposable-VM harnesses
      ↓
hardware and visual evidence
      ↓
exact-SHA release candidate
      ↓
promotion + post-publication verification
```

Repository tooling must fail clearly when host capabilities such as QEMU, KVM, mkarchiso, SSH, or ImageMagick are unavailable. Missing host tooling is not silently treated as passing system evidence.

## Development invariants

- no privileged shell script is the canonical system contract;
- all host-mutating behavior must eventually cross typed Linura authority boundaries;
- system-image/bootstrap/update tooling must be restartable or explicitly recoverable;
- platform-specific code stays under platform/provider/executor boundaries;
- generated artifacts and fixtures are versioned and machine-readable;
- CI actions are pinned to immutable commit SHAs;
- release bytes are built once and promoted, not rebuilt during publication.

The Arch image harness stages from ArchISO's `releng` profile and overlays Linura additions instead of pretending a sparse custom profile is independently boot-complete.
